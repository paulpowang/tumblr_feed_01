# Lab 1 - *Tumblr Feed*

**Tumblr Feed** is a photo browsing app using the [The Tumblr API](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2#posts).

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** user stories are complete:

- [x] User can scroll through a feed of images returned from the Tumblr API (5pts)

The following **stretch** user stories are implemented:

- [x] User sees an alert when there's a networking error (+1pt)
- [ ] While poster is being fetched, user see's a placeholder image (+1pt)
- [ ] User sees image transition for images coming from network, not when it is loaded from cache (+1pt)
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell (+1pt)

The following **additional** user stories are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality! (+1-3pts)

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. I don't really understand how and when to use ! at the end of the line, or as!, or option?
2. I can do it by following the tutorial, but I felt I cannot do it without the instruction.

## Notes

This lab is easy to follow especially after I already completed the assignment.
The challenge is to figure out where I should put the line of the code and some lines that required to modify.
The stretch parts can also be challenging however I haven't start it.

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How I can use git branch to do version control while develop new function on project? Because while I created and modified on local develop branch, it also effects my master branch even I didn't merge it. 
2. How to read and understand the API Guide documentation? There are some notation I don't understand.

## Notes

The lab description is a little bit hard to follow, the project failed when I followed the lab description. However it is very similar to assignment, so I followed assignment tutorial to accomplish this lab.
